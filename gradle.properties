# --- ANTIGRAVITY COMPATIBILITY MODE ---
# Your i3 has 2 physical cores.
# Antigravity Agents need CPU cycles to "think" and update the UI.
# We limit Gradle to 2 workers. Do NOT increase this, or the IDE will freeze.
org.gradle.workers.max=2

# --- MEMORY TUNING ---
# 12GB RAM total: ~4GB for Windows, ~3-4GB for Antigravity (Electron + Agents).
# We allocate 3GB to Gradle. This is the safe limit to prevent crashing.
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx3072m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m -XX:+UseParallelGC

# --- CACHING (CRITICAL FOR i3) ---
# Since your CPU is the weak point, we must reuse every previous build artifact.
org.gradle.caching=true
org.gradle.configuration-cache=true

# --- SPEED OPTIMIZATIONS ---
org.gradle.daemon=true
org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.configureondemand=true

# --- REDUCE TERMINAL NOISE ---
# Antigravity's terminal can lag with too much text output.
# 'plain' console mode saves CPU cycles on rendering text.
org.gradle.console=plain

# --- ANDROID TUNING ---
android.enableJetifier=false
android.useAndroidX=true
# Faster R class generation (saves compilation time)
android.nonTransitiveRClass=true

# --- KOTLIN ---
kotlin.code.style=official
